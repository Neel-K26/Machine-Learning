| `Matplotlib and Seaborn`        | Visualization techniques for EDA and model evaluation |
| `KNN and K means`               | Distance-based classification and unsupervised clustering |
| `Naive Bayes`                   | Probabilistic classification using conditional independence |
| `Decision Trees`                | Tree-based models with pruning, entropy/Gini, and visualization |
| `Regression`                    | Linear, polynomial regression, residuals, and metrics |
| `SVM`                           | Kernel-based classification with margin maximization |
| `PCA`                           | Dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data |
| `DL Basic`                      | Intro to neural networks using TensorFlow or PyTorch |
| `Untitled files {testing purpose}` | Scratch space for experimental or test notebooks (excluded from core repo logic) |
